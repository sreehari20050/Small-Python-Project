I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.



Create a function called life_in_weeks() using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.



It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:



You have x weeks left.



Where x is replaced with the actual calculated number of weeks the input age has left until age 90.



**Warning** The function must be called life_in_weeks for the tests to pass. Also the output must have the same punctuation and spelling as the example. Including the full stop!



Example Input

56



Example Output

You have 1768 weeks left.



How to test your code and see your output?


def life_in_weeks(age):
  # your code here


# Call your function with hard coded values
life_in_weeks(12)
